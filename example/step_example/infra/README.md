# Step Functions + ECS Infrastructure

This directory was generated by `kptn codegen-infra` for the `basic` pipeline.
It scaffolds the core AWS resources required to execute kptn tasks via AWS Step Functions
and ECS.

## Contents

- `main.tf` provisions the Step Functions state machine, IAM role, and CloudWatch log group.
- `networking.tf` optionally creates a VPC, subnets, and security group when `create_networking` is true.
- `ecs.tf` optionally creates an ECS cluster when `create_ecs_cluster` is true.
- `task_definition.tf` optionally creates an ECS task definition when `create_task_definition` is true.
- `ecr.tf` optionally creates an ECR repository when `create_ecr_repository` is true.
- `task_execution_role.tf` optionally creates an ECS task execution role when `create_task_execution_role` is true.
- `locals.tf` centralizes computed references reused across the stack.
- `variables.tf` defines configuration inputs used by the Terraform stack.
- `outputs.tf` surfaces useful identifiers after `terraform apply` runs.

## Workflow

1. Ensure the kptn Step Functions definition JSON is up to date by running `kptn codegen`.
2. Decide whether to reuse existing AWS resources or provision new ones:
   - Set `create_networking`, `create_security_group`, `create_ecr_repository`,
     `create_task_definition`, `create_task_execution_role`, and/or
     `create_ecs_cluster` to `true` to scaffold fresh infrastructure.
   - Leave them `false` and populate `vpc_id`, `subnet_ids`, `security_group_ids`,
     `ecr_repository_url`, `ecs_task_definition_arn`, `ecs_task_execution_role_arn`,
     and `ecs_cluster_arn` to reuse existing resources.
3. Update `terraform.tfvars` (generated via the interactive CLI, if used) with environment-specific values
   such as subnet IDs, security groups, ECS ARNs, task definitions, and networking CIDRs.
4. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -var="pipeline_name=basic"
   terraform apply -var="pipeline_name=basic"
   ```

   Include additional `-var` flags or reference a `.tfvars` file as needed.

Review the generated Terraform files to tailor permissions, logging, and network access policies to
match your organization's standards.
